== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

Pop-ups. Have a look at the [Boxzilla demo site](https://demo.boxzillaplugin.com/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=boxzilla&utm_campaign=description).

= How to display a form in the box? =

Boxzilla will work with any plugin that allows for shortcodes, like [MailChimp for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/) or [HTML Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/html-forms/).

= Can I have a box open after clicking a certain link or button? =

Yes, you can create a link that refers the box ID. For example, if your box has an ID of 94.

`
<a href="#boxzilla-94">Open Box</a>
`

= Can I have a box open right after loading a page? =

You can configure this in the box settings. Or you can add `#boxzilla-13` to your URL, where 13 is the ID of the box you want to show.

= Can I customize the appearance of a box =

Boxzilla comes with a simple interface for customizing the pop-up appearance. But you can also use your own custom CSS if needed.

`
.boxzilla { } /* all boxes */
.boxzilla-5 { } /* only the box with ID 5 */
`

= I want to disable auto-paragraphs in the box content =

All default WordPress filters are added to the `boxzilla_box_content` filter hook. The example below shows how to remove them.

`
remove_filter( 'boxzilla_box_content', 'wptexturize') ;
remove_filter( 'boxzilla_box_content', 'convert_smilies' );
remove_filter( 'boxzilla_box_content', 'convert_chars' );
remove_filter( 'boxzilla_box_content', 'wpautop' );
remove_filter( 'boxzilla_box_content', 'do_shortcode' );
remove_filter( 'boxzilla_box_content', 'shortcode_unautop' );
`
